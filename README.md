# bouncing_ball
A PixiJS scene, where a ball is bouncing up and down.

# How to get started
To sart the scene, first the repository needed to be downloaded.
After downnloading it and opening the folder it is needed to 'cd bouncing_ball' from 'bouncing_ball-master'.
Next step is to 'npm start' and this should launch the scene, however in case of any kind of error, the node
modules are requiered to be deleted and then 'npm install' to get them again and now it shuld work.

# Realism
The ball is getting slower as the time passes when it is going up and it gets faster as it gets closer to the ground.
The ball has a shadow, which dinamically changes based on the ball's distance from the ground.
The ball keeps rotating while it bounces, however if the speed gets decreased to the minimum (0) it stops moving and rotating.
