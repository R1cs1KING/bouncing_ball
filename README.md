# bouncing_ball
A PixiJS scene, where a ball is bouncing up and down.

To sart the scene, first the repository needed to be downloaded.
After downnloading it and opening the folder it is needed to 'cd bouncing_ball' from 'bouncing_ball-master'.
Next step is to 'npm start' ad this should launch the scene, however in case of any type of error the node
modules are requiered to be deleted and then 'npm install' to get them again and now it shuld work.
